The president shall inform the general body of elections at least two weeks in advance. Elections shall be decided, in accordance with the Executive Council Elections Policy, by a plurality vote of those members present and voting. Nominees shall not be present for the discussion of or vote on the office for which they are nominated. Members shall not hold more than one elected or appointed H'n'H office, with the exception of Vice President of Production. The detailed regulations regarding this special case are to be dictated by Executive Policy. If no nominee is deemed suitable for a given office by the General Membership, then the Executive Council shall appoint the position.

In the event of a vacancy in the office of President, the Business Manager shall assume the office until a special election can be held.

                                        An Officer failing to discharge the duties outlined in these Bylaws and the associated Policy addenda may be subject to impeachment. Any general body or executive council member may petition to bring articles of impeachment against any officer. Ten signatures are required to bring forth articles of impeachment. An impeachment must involve an open, publicized trial that occurs before the general body. Before the trial, the secretary (or in the case of the impeachment of the secretary, the president) shall inform the chair of the Student Organization Finance Committee. Impeachment requires a secret ballot simple majority vote of the general body, excluding the member under impeachment. In the event of the impeachment of the President, the trial shall be chaired by the Business Manager. Once removed from office, a member may not hold office again unless the removal is rescinded by a two-thirds vote of the Executive Council.

                                General Membership meetings shall be governed by the President according to the following guidelines: <br><br>

                                <ul>
                                <li>Maintaining order is the number one priority. Have those who wish to speak raise their hands, and call on them one at a time. If at any time more than two people are engaging in discussion, interrupt and ask that they please wait their turn to speak. This rule also applies at the President's discretion if and when anyone starts to get out of hand. Rude remarks should be reprimanded, and a pleasant, calm atmosphere encouraged.</li>
                                <li>Keep discussions succinct. Elections and show selections tend to trigger circular conversations. Once the membership has shed equal light upon all of the viewpoints, ask if anyone is undecided or if there are any further questions, and call for a vote. This discourages arguments and wasting time.</li>
                                <li>During a vote, all members should close their eyes and raise their hand for the option they are selecting. If the vote is particularly controversial, the President may call for a written ballot vote. Ideally the election format should be decided upon prior to the meeting. There should always be at least two people counting the votes--ideally the President and the Advisor. In the event that the Advisor cannot attend the General Membership meeting, the Business Manager should fulfill this role. In this case, the Business Manager continues to receive a vote.</li>
                                <li>The President should not, under any circumstances and in any way, reveal the tallies of votes after or during the meeting. This includes votes in which a majority has been clearly reached prior to finishing out the options.</li>

                            </ul>
                                Structure of the meeting itself is to be determined on a case by case basis.

                                It is the President's responsibility to ensure the VP of Production has a handle on his or her workload. This does not mean doing all the work, but being a valuable resource for questions or concerns.

                                <p>The Publicity Chair is primarily responsible for transition publicity--promoting Hoof 'n' Horn itself rather than the shows it produces. This includes any stand-alone cabarets, interviews for Production Councils, and any other event that Hoof 'n' Horn is hosting. The Publicity Chair should be available for support and advice to each Vice President of Production for promoting each of the three yearly shows. As with every Chair on the Council, the Publicity Chair may also be expected to help with other tasks at the discretion of the President.<br><br>

                                <p>The Playreading Chair should interview interested parties in order to compile a committee of four members, one from each class. This committee will fulfill the duties outlined in the Hoof'n'Horn Bylaws. It should be noted the Playreading Committee is an extension of the Executive Council, with the purpose of collecting information and making a final ballot recommendation to the Executive Council. It is the job of Exec to approve this ballot or make necessary changes based on a majority vote. <br><br>

                                A major goal of any Hoof 'n' Horn show is to produce a profit. That being said, the following are objectives to be met by each production slot:
                                <ul>
                                <li>The Fall Production should be a recognizable and marketable show which will generate interest for new cast and audience members. In the interest of recruiting many new members, the show should have an elastic cast that will allow the casting of a large chorus or a smaller one depending on the audition pool.</li>
                                <li>The Winter Production should have a smaller cast, and, to a degree, be more of an experimental show. It should not require a large budget, but should instead focus more on opportunities for specific or different styles of acting and directing.</li>
                                <li>The Spring Production should be a family-friendly show with capability of name recognition. This production is Hoof 'n' Horn's primary seller and needs to make up for any losses acquired from the Fall and Winter Productions in the smaller Sheafer Theater. The cast should be large, and the budget may be larger than that of the Fall and Winter. The goal of this "big name" show is that the name of the show is in and of itself advertisement, which aids us in selling tickets for graduation weekend.</li>
                                </ul>
                                The Playreading Chair must present three shows for the ballot and an alternate show to the Executive Council two weeks before the General Body meeting. Then, the rights contracts to all of the shows and the alternate must be applied for so the rights will be received by the Retreat. This will ensure that we have the rights to any show decided upon at the meeting.<br><br>

This pertains specifically to cast parties, beach week, and the Freshman Orientation Cabaret, though there will almost always be other events. The Membership Chair(s) are ultimately responsible for making sure the cabaret goes up in performance-worthy condition, which requires organizing performers and arranging for a performance space. The Membership Chair(s) should coordinate with the Publicity Chair and Committee to publicize the event and the Fundraising Chair and Committee if the event is not a benefit. The Membership Chair(s) are also expected to book a house on the beach for the week between finals and graduation weekend, traditionally at Emerald Isle, and is responsible for collecting money from all H'n'H members who plan to attend beforehand. The Membership Chair(s) are responsible for the coordination of everything having to do with this week, including grocery shopping, crowd control, and safety matters.

                                <li>To garner the proper funds for his/her show, the producer(s) is (are) responsible for proposing a budget to the business manager and executive council for approval, as per the bylaws.

                                With this method of fund management, organization and accountability become augmented. This method of managing the accounts emphasizes the importance of a responsible budget and careful spending.
